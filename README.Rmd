# Retirement

---

This package is no longer under active development and no new functionality will
be added. You should instead be using `group_map()`, `group_modify()` and
`group_walk()` functions from `dplyr`. See:
<https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_map.html>

This is for two reasons-

1. `dplyr 0.8.1` introduced `group_map()`, `group_modify()` and `group_walk()`
   functions that can be used to iterate on grouped dataframes. So if you want
   to do `grouped_` operations, I would highly recommend using these functions
   over `groupedstats` functions since the former are much more general,
   efficient, and faster than the latter. For more, see:
   <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_map.html>

2. There are more general versions of these functions introduced in `broomExtra`
   package:<br> `grouped_tidy`, `grouped_augment`, `grouped_glance`. For more,
   see:
   <https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/broomExtra/reference/index.html#section-grouped-variants-of-generics>

# Overview

`groupedstats` package provides a collection of functions to run statistical
operations on multiple variables across multiple grouping variables in a
dataframe. This is a common situation, as illustrated by few example cases-

1. If you have combined multiple studies in a single dataframe and want to run a
   common operation (e.g., linear regression) on **each study**. In this case,
   column corresponding to `study` will be the grouping variable.

2. If you have multiple groups in your dataframe (e.g., clinical disorder groups
   and controls group) and you want to carry out the same operation for **each
   group** (e.g., planned t-test to check for differences in reaction time in
   condition 1 versus condition 2 for both groups). In this case, `group` will
   be the grouping variable.

3. If you have multiple conditions in a given study (e.g., six types of videos
   participants saw) and want to run a common operation between different
   measures of interest for **each condition** (e.g., correlation between
   subjective rating of emotional intensity and reaction time).

4. Combination of all of the above.
