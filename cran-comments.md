## Comments

  - Although I had requested to archive the package, users who had been using
  the package contacted and asked that it be retained as is on CRAN; even if it
  doesn't get many downloads or even if there are better options available. This
  ensures that their scripts written in the past would continue to work.
  Apologies for the change in mind; should have given it more thought.
